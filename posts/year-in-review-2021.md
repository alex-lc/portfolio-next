# Year in Review (2021)

Since 2020 it seems like time has not been real. Somehow we are now in 2022 and although not a lot makes sense anymore these days, 2021 has brought a lot of progress in terms of growth in my life.

In 2021 I decided to pursue a different position and left my previous company to start as a Support Developer for Coalfire, mainly working on an application that ingests security data and findings from penetration tests, static and dynamic code analysis, and more. The goal of the application is to effectively bridge the gap between development and security teams to streamline the software development process, which as we saw in 2021, is very needing of good security practices.

This move has been incredible and I absolutely love my new company and team. It has thrown me into the world of Java which has pulled me out of my JavaScript comfort zone and really challenged my ability to learn. Java can be tough to get a grasp on, but I can already feel working with it strengthening my programming skills as a whole, and I am excited to continue expanding on that this year.

## This year I'd like to accomplish:

- Continue getting stronger with Java
- Finish and deploy a side project
- Build or contribute to some open-source security tools
- Get my eJPT certification

I am sure that this year will go faster than the last as they all seem to, but I am hopeful for what it brings. To 2022.
