# How I Passed the CompTIA Security+ Exam

Roughly a month and a half ago I decided it was time to get my first certification. The CompTIA Security+ was my first choice as it was an entry level certification that I already felt pretty confident that I could pass if I put the work in.

I studied after work during the weekdays, a lot on the weekends when I had the free time, and ended up passing to take my first step into the cyber security community.

## Methods I found most useful

* Flashcards
* Videos
* Practice Tests

The *first* thing I did was read through the exam's objectives to identify which topics I was already familiar with, versus those that I knew I __needed__ to dive deeper into.

After that, I took those topics and searched through YouTube to create a playlist of tutorials that covered those topics. I went through this playlist anytime I was not watching through the official courses I purchased or taking a practice exam.

## Official Courses

There were two official courses that I went through: Jason Dion's and Professor Messer's.

### Jason Dion

Jason Dion's Udemy course is typically $89.00, but sometimes you can catch a sale where a number of courses drop down to around $10.00 each. I took advantage of this sale and this is when I purchased his full course, as well as his course that was just six practice exams.

Although these weren't free materials, they were easily the most helpful in getting me prepared for the exam. The full course went through each exam objective in enough detail to grasp the concept, but quick enough to keep you engaged. On top of that, the practice tests did a wonderful job of posing situational based questions which is what you should practice a lot in preparation for the Security+ exam. 

Learn a concept and then practice applying that concept in a scenario. It will benefit you greatly.

### Professor Messer

The greatest part of Professor Messer's material is that it's 100% free. He does an excellent job of covering all of the exam objectives in enough detail that you can then decide if you need to seek out supplemental material to reinforce your learning.

Because I already purchased Jason Dion's courses, I chose not to purchase any of Professor Messer's premium material, but I saw many positive reviews for his material that you have to pay for.

## Practice Tests

Jason Dion's 6 practice exams were by far the most helpful, but I also went through all 24 mini practice tests that Exam Compass has for the Security+ exam.

I wouldn't recommend relying on these alone as the practice exams that Exam Compass offers are shorter and really only focus on definitional knowledge. Knowing the content on the exam is important, but knowing __how__ to use the content in a given scenario on the exam is far more crucial in earning you that passing score.

## Flash Cards

There is a lot of terminology that you should be able to identify either by its acronym or by its description. To help with recalling all of the terms, along with the commonly used ports, I used flash cards.

I wrote either the acronym or port number on the front of the card, and its definition or service on the back. A great way to use flash cards is by starting with the ones you know to make sure that you have them down, then slowly adding three to five more at a time, and repeating the process until you can make it through the entire stack of cards without issues.

I would go through the current stack of cards I was learning using the front, and then the next time, use the back. You want to be able to recall both sides without having to look at the card in the end. Once you feel confident in moving through your completed stack of flash cards both ways, you should be fairly ready for the exam.

## Take it Easy

![Take a Break](/files/images/walk_through_park.png)

The most important advice I can give is to just take it easy. If there is anything I have learned through the years, both in college and my learning experiences beyond that is that taking a break to breathe and relax your mind is one of the best things you can do to prepare yourself.

Whether it's playing some video games to reset your mind or taking a walk in the park with your dog, you don't want to burn your mind out because it will not serve you well when it's time to take your exam.

When it is time to take the exam, take a deep breath and be confident in yourself. If you gave your best effort in preparing, then you should see that passing score flash before your eyes at the end of the 90 minutes, hopefully bringing about as big of a smile for you as it did for me.

Best of luck! If you have any questions, you are more than welcome to reach out to me.
