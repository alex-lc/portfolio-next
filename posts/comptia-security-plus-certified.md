# I am certified!

There is __no__ better feeling than setting a goal for yourself that pushes you to take a step outside of your box and then achieving it. There are several notable moments in my life that I could not help but smile and feel pride in what I had accomplished. Among these are moving out on my own and getting my first apartment, walking up the stands to see my teary eyed parents after I earned my degree and graduated from college, and now, gaining my first cybersecurity certification.

While it is an entry level cybersecurity certification, it still signifies that I took the time and put forth the effort to taking that first step into this industry.

I am passionate about web development because it draws out the creativity in me, but at the same time, the world of application security and cyber security fascinate me. It is a battleground that the average user is completely oblivious to and is *extremely* important to the world of technology and society as a whole.

As of __July 22, 2021__, I am now __CompTIA Security+ certified__! Through my experience in my current role, and my first cybersecurity certification, I can say that I now have a foot inside this world and I am hungry to continue to learn and become immersed in it.


## What is next?

The next goal I am setting for myself is to earn the __eJPT__ certification from eLearnSecurity. I feel like this is a great next step as it is more hands on and involved, versus the multiple choice question, almost completely theory based style of the CompTIA Security+.

In addition to this, I am still working on my full stack development skillset as well. TypeScript, Next.js, React Native, Docker, and Kubernetes are just a few of the things I am focusing in on to expand my toolkit.

My flashcard application that I was developing in order to aid my studying for the Security+ exam is still in the works as well, and I am still planning on finishing it and actually deploying it to production. Next.js has been awesome to work with and learn and I will probably be using it for the majority of my projects going forward.


## How did I pass?

![Guide Coming Soon](/public/files/images/guide.png)

I am going to do a separate write up and blog post detailing the ways that I studied for the CompTIA Security+ exam, what resources I used, and what I found most helpful in achieving my passing score. I ended up getting 816 points out of the required 750 to pass, which felt amazing.

More to come in regards to that soon. ðŸ¥³
