I plan to take the CompTIA Security+ exam sometime early to mid July in order to have one attempt before the exam is changed to the newer set of objectives.

Udemy was having a great sale where a lot of courses were just $10.00, which allowed to get my hands on Jason Dion's courses in addition to six practice exams. On top of this, I am using Professor Messer's free videos to really hammer down the objectives. I'm hoping to get Security+ certified on my first attempt so that I can move onto something more hands on like the eJPT. The CompTIA certifications definitely cover a lot, but I feel that more hands on certifications are more worth it in the long run.
