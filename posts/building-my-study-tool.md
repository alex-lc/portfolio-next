## Next.js

Next.js has been on my list of things to dive deeper into for quite some time now. As I have been ramping up my cyber security studies, I wanted to find a way to continue hammering down web development skills at the __same time__.

For my CompTIA Security+ studies, I have been using good old fashioned paper flashcards for sections of the exam like ports, where a lot of recall is required.

I decided to build a flashcard app to enable me to easily create different stacks of cards related to my studies that I could interact with through Next.js and React. This is an ongoing project, but I have made some good headway and learned a lot about Next.js in the process. For example, authentication through NextAuth makes setting up oAuth through providers like Google, Github, Discord, etc. a breeze.

The main features I am working on right now include:

* "Play" mode to study flashcards that is easy to use and enables user focus
* Break down stacks of flashcards into chunks by allowing the user to set cards as "learned" once they feel like they don't need to review them anymore.

I have a lot of plans for this app to showcase my React and Next.js knowledge over time and I will continue to blog as I build to keep track of my progress.
