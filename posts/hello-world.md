I am taking the time to recreate my portfolio using Next.js as I learn the benefits it can provide on top of React.

Its static generation and server-side rendering abilities are reason enough to use it, in addition to other neat features such as file based routing. I am loving learning it so far and I plan to use it often in my future projects.

In other news, as I am picking up Next.js, I am currently studying to take the CompTIA Security+ exam sometime at the beginning of July. I hope to get one entry level certification under my belt and start to make the transition into cyber security and web application penetration testing. I want to focus in on being a security focused developer who can bring a security mindset to the development cycle.

My portfolio will be under construction for awhile as I am building portions of it after work and when I can find some free time.
