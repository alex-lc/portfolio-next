It seems like there is never enough time in the day. When you set out to learn a number of new skills, it can feel like there is not enough time to dedicate to absorbing enough information from each to feel productive, especially when your time is limited to your nights after work. Factor in your responsibilities and commitments outside of technology and the days zoom by in the blink of an eye.

It takes a lot of focus and prioritization to make it work, but the end goal that you set and work towards should be worth it and give you the drive necessary to continue to push closer to it each and every day.

There is about half a month left before I plan to take my first attempt at the CompTIA Security+ exam, and I am feeling pretty confident that I can do well. If that all goes well, I am immediately moving onto to studying for the eJPT exam which is the next target in my sights. I am going to continue moving down a cyber security path, but am also working hard on my full stack development skills at the same time.

The main side project I am working on right now is called Ubbsorb, and it is going to be a full stack SaaS flashcard app built with Next.js. I want to completely build and deploy it to have that end to end experience, especially with Next.js which I have been having an awesome time learning. It brings so much extra power to React, and it has super charged my spark for web development.

I am going to also dive deeper into React Native to build a standalone mobile app for all of my side projects as well. React Native seems like a very sought out after skill right now as its popularity continues to grow due to the benefit of being able to use React and JavaScript for your mobile app, frontend, and backend. 

The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. Sometimes it can be an overwhelming feeling, but it is a humbling experience that allows you to get inspired to continue learning and growing as an individual. I have high hopes and plans for the future, and despite there sometimes feeling like there isn't enough time in the day, I am making it work.
